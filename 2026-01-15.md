# NOW I BRING THE ARTICLE IN

“Well, I’m just like a person, too.” It’s funny that Clare is bringing this up; back in 1999 Dr. Kendrick and I are engaged in philosophical [[trench]] [[warfare]] over this very issue. Kendrick is convinced that I am a harbinger of a new species of human, as different from everyday folks as Cro-Magnon Man was from his Neanderthal neighbors. I [[contend]] that I’m just a piece of messed-up code, and our inability to have kids proves that I’m not going to be the Missing Link. We’ve taken to quoting Kierkegaard and Heidegger at each other and glowering. Meanwhile, Clare regards me doubtfully. “ People don’t appear and disappear the way you do. You’re like the Cheshire Cat.” “Are you implying that I’m a fictional character?” I spot my move, finally: King’s Rook to QR3. Now she can take my bishop but she’ll lose her queen in the process. It takes Clare a moment to realize this and when she does she sticks out her tongue at me. Her tongue is a worrisome shade of orange from all the Doritos she’s eaten. “It makes me kind of wonder about fairy tales. I mean, if you’re real, then why shouldn’t fairy tales be real, too?” Clare stands up, still pondering the board, and does a little dance, hopping around like her pants are on fire. “I think the ground is getting harder. My butt’s asleep.” “Maybe they are real. Or some little thing in them is real and then people just added to it, you know?” “Like maybe Snow White was in a coma?” “And Sleeping Beauty, too.” “And Jack the beanstalk guy was just a real terrific gardener.” “And Noah was a weird old man with a houseboat and a lot of cats.” Clare stares at me. “Noah is in the Bible. He’s not a fairy tale.” “Oh. Right. Sorry.” I’m getting very hungry. Any minute now Nell will ring the dinner bell and Clare will have to go in. She sits back down on her side of the board. I can tell she’s lost interest in the game when she starts building a little pyramid out of all the conquered pieces. “You still haven’t proved you’re real” Clare says. “Neither have you.” “Do you ever wonder if I’m real?” she asks me, surprised. “Maybe I’m dreaming you. Maybe you’re dreaming me; maybe we only exist in each other’s dreams and every morning when we wake up we forget all about each other.” Clare frowns, and makes a motion with her hand as though to bat away this odd idea. “Pinch me,” she requests. I lean over and pinch her lightly on the arm. “Harder!” I do it again, hard enough to leave a white and red mark that [[linger]]s for some seconds and then vanishes. “Don’t you think I would wake up, if I was asleep? Anyway, I don’t feel asleep.” “Well, I don’t feel like a spirit. Or a fictional character.” “How do you know? I mean, if I was making you up, and I didn’t want you to know you were made up, I just wouldn’t tell you, right?” I [[wiggle]] my eyebrows at her. “Maybe God just made us up and He’s not telling us.” “You shouldn’t say things like that,” Clare exclaims. “Besides, you don’t even believe in God. Do you?” I shrug, and change the subject. “I’m more real than Paul McCartney.” Clare looks worried. She starts to put all the pieces back in their box, carefully dividing white and black. “Lots of people know about Paul McCartney—I’m the only one who knows about you.” “But you’ve actually met me, and you’ve never met him.” “My mom went to a Beatles concert.” She closes the lid of the chess set and stretches out on the ground, staring up at the [[canopy]] of new leaves. “It was at Comiskey Park, in Chicago, August 8,1965.” I poke her in the stomach and she curls up like a [[hedgehog]], giggling. After an interval of tickling and thrashing around, we lie on the ground with our hands clasped across our middles and Clare asks, “Is your wife a time traveler too?” “Nope. Thank God.” “Why ‘thank God’? I think that would be fun. You could go places together.” “One time traveler per family is more than enough. It’s dangerous, Clare.” “Does she worry about you?” “Yes,” I say softly. “She does.” I wonder what Clare is doing now, in 1999. Maybe she’s still asleep. Maybe she won’t know I’m gone. “Do you love her?” “Very much,” I whisper. We He silently side by side, watching the swaying trees, the birds, the sky. I hear a muffled [[sniffling]] noise and glancing at Clare I am astonished to see that tears are streaming across her face toward her ears. I sit up and lean over her. “What’s wrong, Clare?” She just shakes her head back and forth and presses her lips together. I smooth her hair, and pull her into a sitting position, wrap my arms around her. She’s a child, and then again she isn’t. “What’s wrong?” It comes out so quietly that I have to ask her to repeat it: “It’s just that I thought maybe you were married to me.”

Wednesday, June 27, [[1984]] ([[Clare]] is [[13]])

CLARE: I am standing in the Meadow. It’s late June, late afternoon; in a few minutes it will be time to wash up for supper. The temperature is dropping. Ten minutes ago the sky was [[coppery]] blue and there was a heavy heat over the Meadow, everything felt curved, like being under a vast glass dome, all near noises swallowed up in the heat while an overwhelming [[chorus]] of insects [[droned]]. I have been sitting on the tiny footbridge watching waterbugs skating on the still small pool, thinking about Henry. Today isn’t a Henry day; the next one is twenty-two days away. It is now much cooler. Henry is puzzling to me. All my life I have pretty much just accepted Henry as no big deal; that is, although Henry is a secret and therefore automatically fascinating, Henry is also some kind of miracle and just recently it’s started to dawn on me that most girls don’t have a Henry or if they do they’ve all been pretty quiet about it. There’s a wind coming; the tall grass is [[rippling]] and I close my eyes so it sounds like the sea (which I have never seen except on TV). When I open them the sky is yellow and then green. Henry says he comes from the future. When I was little I didn’t see any problem with that; I didn’t have any idea what it might mean. Now I wonder if it means that the future is a place, or like a place, that I could go to; that is go to in some way other than just getting older. I wonder if Henry could take me to the future. The woods are black and the trees bend over and [[whip]] to the side and bow down. The insect hum is gone and the wind is smoothing everything, the grass is flat and the trees are [[creaking]] and [[groaning]]. I am afraid of the future; it seems to be a big box waiting for me. Henry says he knows me in the future. Huge black clouds are moving up from behind the trees, they come up so suddenly that I laugh, they are like puppets, and everything is swirling toward me and there is a long low [[peal]] of thunder. I am suddenly aware of myself standing thin and upright in a Meadow where everything has [[flattened]] itself down and so I lie down hoping to be unnoticed by the storm which rolls up and I am flat on my back looking up when water begins to pour down from the sky. My clothes are soaked in an instant and I suddenly feel that Henry is there, an incredible need for Henry to be there and to put his hands on me even while it seems to me that Henry is the rain and I am alone and wanting him.

Sunday, September 23, [[1984]] (Henry is [[35]], Clare is [[13]])

HENRY: I am in the clearing, in the Meadow. It’s very early in the morning, just before dawn. It’s late summer, all the flowers and grasses are up to my chest. It’s chilly. I am alone. I [[wade]] through the plants and locate the clothes box, open it up, and find blue jeans and a white oxford shirt and [[flip-flops]]. I’ve never seen these clothes before, so I have no idea where I am in time. Clare has also left me a snack: there’s a peanut butter and jelly sandwich carefully wrapped in aluminum [[foil]], with an apple and a bag of lay’s potato chips. Maybe this is one of Clare’s school lunches. My expectations veer in the direction of the late seventies or early eighties. I sit down on the rock and eat the food, and then I feel much better. The sun is rising. The whole Meadow is blue, and then orange, and pink, the shadows are [[elongated]], and then it is day. There’s no sign of Clare. I crawl a few feet into the [[vegetation]], curl up on the ground even though it is wet with [[dew]], and sleep. When I wake up the sun is higher and Clare is sitting next to me reading a book. She smiles at me and says, “Daylight in the swamp. The birds are singing and the frogs are croaking and it’s time to get up!” I [[groan]] and rub my eyes. “Hi, Clare. What’s the date?” “Sunday, September 23, 1984.” Clare is thirteen. A strange and difficult age, but not as difficult as what we are going through in my present. I sit up, and yawn. “Clare, if I asked very nicely, would you go into your house and smuggle out a cup of coffee for me?” “Coffee?” Clare says this as though she has never heard of the substance. As an adult she is as much of an addict as I am. She considers the logistics. “Pretty please?” “Okay, I’ll try.” She stands up, slowly. This is the year Clare got tall, quickly. In the past year she has grown five inches, and she has not yet become [[accustomed]] to her new body. Breasts and legs and hips, all newly [[minted]]. I try not to think about it as I watch her walk up the path to the house. I glance at the book she was reading. It’s a Dorothy Sayers, one I haven’t read. I’m on page thirty-three by the time she gets back. She has brought a Thermos, cups, a blanket, and some doughnuts. A summer’s worth of sun has freckled Clare’s nose, and I have to resist the urge to run my hands through her [[bleached]] hair, which falls over her arms as she spreads out the blanket. “Bless you.” I receive the Thermos as though it contains a [[sacrament]]. We settle ourselves on the blanket. I kick off the flip-flops, pour out a cup of coffee, and take a sip. It’s incredibly strong and bitter. “Yowza! This is rocket fuel, Clare.” “Too strong?” She looks a little depressed, and I [[hasten]] to compliment her. “Well, there’s probably no such thing as too strong, but it’s pretty strong. I like it, though. Did you make it?” “Uh-huh. I never made coffee before, and Mark came in and was kind of bugging me, so maybe I did it wrong.” “No, it’s fine.” I blow on the coffee, and [[gulp]] it down. I feel better immediately. I pour another cup. Clare takes the Thermos from me. She pours herself half an inch of coffee and takes a cautious sip. “Ugh,” she says. “This is disgusting. Is it supposed to taste like this?” “Well, it’s usually a little less [[ferocious]]. You like yours with lots of cream and sugar.”
Clare pours the rest of her coffee into the Meadow and takes a doughnut. Then she says, “You’re making me into a freak.” I don’t have a ready reply for this, since the idea has never occurred to me. “Uh, no I’m not.” “You are so.” “Am not.” I pause. “What do you mean, I’m making you into a freak? I’m not making you into anything.” “You know, like telling me that I like coffee with cream and sugar before I hardly even taste it. I mean, how am I going to figure out if that’s what I like or if I just like it because you tell me I like it?” “But Clare, it’s just personal taste. You should be able to figure out how you like coffee whether I say anything or not. Besides, you’re the one who’s always bugging me to tell you about the future.” “Knowing the future is different from being told what I like,” Clare says. “Why? It’s all got to do with free will.” Clare takes off her shoes and socks. She pushes the socks into the shoes and places them neatly at the edge of the blanket. Then she takes my cast-off flip-flops and aligns them with her shoes, as though the blanket is a tatami mat. “I thought free will had to do with sin.” I think about this. “No, ” I say, “why should free will be limited to right and wrong? I mean, you just decided, of your own free will, to take off your shoes. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares if you wear shoes or not, and it’s not sinful, or virtuous, and it doesn’t affect the future, but you’ve exercised your free will” Clare shrugs. “But sometimes you tell me something and I feel like the future is already there, you know? Like my future has happened in the past and I can’t do anything about it.” “That’s called determinism,” I tell her. “It haunts my dreams.” Clare is [[intrigued]]. “Why?” “Well, if you are feeling boxed in by the idea that your future is [[unalterable]], imagine how I feel. I’m constantly running up against the fact that I can’t change anything, even though I am right there, watching it.” “But Henry, you do change things! I mean, you wrote down that stuff that I’m supposed to give you in 1991 about the baby with Down Syndrome, And the List, if I didn’t have the List I would never know when to come meet you. You change things all the time.” I smile. “I can only do things that work toward what has already happened. I can’t, for example, undo the fact that you just took off your shoes.” Clare laughs. “Why would you care if I take them off or not?”
“I don’t. But even if I did, it’s now an unalterable part of the history of the universe and I can’t do a thing about it.” I help myself to a doughnut. It’s a Bismarck, my favorite. The frosting is melting in the sun a little, and it sticks to my fingers. Clare finishes her doughnut, rolls up the cuffs of her jeans and sits cross-legged. She scratches her neck and looks at me with annoyance. “Now you’re making me self-conscious. I feel like every time I blow my nose it’s a historic event.” “Well, it is.” She rolls her eyes. “What’s the opposite of determinism?” “Chaos.” “Oh. I don’t think I like that. Do you like that?” I take a big bite out of the Bismarck and consider chaos. “Well, I do and I don’t. Chaos is more freedom; in fact, total freedom. But no meaning. I want to be free to act, and I also want my actions to mean something.” “But, Henry, you’re forgetting about God—why can’t there be a God who makes it mean something?” Clare frowns [[earnestly]], and looks away across the Meadow as she speaks. I pop the last of the Bismarck into my mouth and chew slowly to gain time. Whenever Clare mentions God my palms start to sweat and I have an urge to hide or run or vanish. “I don’t know, Clare. I mean, to me things seem too random and meaningless for there to be a God.” Clare [[clasps]] her arms around her knees. “But you just said before that everything seems like it’s all planned out beforehand.” “Hpmf,” I say. I grab Clare’s ankles, pull her feet onto my lap, and hold on. Clare laughs, and leans back on her elbows. Clare’s feet are cold in my hands; they are very pink and very clean. “Okay,” I say, “let’s see. The choices we’re working with here are a block universe, where past, present and future all coexist [[simultaneously]] and everything has already happened; chaos, where anything can happen and nothing can be predicted because we can’t know all the variables; and a Christian universe in which God made everything and it’s all here for a purpose but we have free will anyway. Right?” Clare [[wiggles]] her toes at me. “I guess.” “And what do you vote for?” Clare is silent. Her [[pragmatism]] and her romantic feelings about Jesus and Mary are, at thirteen, almost equally balanced. A year ago she would have said God without hesitation. In ten years she will vote for determinism, and ten years after that Clare will believe that the universe is [[arbitrary]], that if God exists he does not hear our prayers, that cause and effect are inescapable and brutal, but meaningless. And after that? I don’t know. But right now Clare sits on the threshold of [[adolescence]] with her faith in one hand and her growing [[skepticism]] in the other, and all she can do is try to [[juggle]] them, or squeeze them together until they fuse. She shakes her head. “I don’t know. I want God. Is that okay?” I feel like an asshole. “Of course it’s okay. That’s what you believe.” “But I don’t want to just believe it, I want it to be true.” I run my thumbs across Clare’s arches, and she closes her eyes. “You and St. Thomas Aquinas both,” I say. “I’ve heard of him,” Clare says, as though she’s speaking of a long-lost favorite uncle, or the host of a TV show she used to watch when she was little. “He wanted order and reason, and God, too. He lived in the thirteenth century and taught at the University of Paris. Aquinas believed in both Aristotle and angels.” “I love angels,” says Clare. “They’re so beautiful. I wish I could have wings and fly around and sit on clouds.” “Ein jeder Engel ist schrecklich.‘” Clare sighs, a little soft sigh that means I don’t speak German, remember? “Huh?” “‘Every angel is terrifying.’ It’s part of a series of poems called The Duino Elegies, by a poet named Rilke. He’s one of our favorite poets.” Clare laughs. “You’re doing it again!” “What?” “Telling me what I like.” Clare burrows into my lap with her feet. Without thinking I put her feet on my shoulders, but then that seems too sexual, somehow, and I quickly take Clare’s feet in my hands again and hold them together with one hand in the air as she lies on her back, innocent and angelic with her hair spread nimbus-like around her on the blanket. I tickle her feet. Clare giggles and twists out of my hands like a fish, jumps up and does a cartwheel across the clearing, grinning at me as if to dare me to come and get her. I just grin back, and she returns to the blanket and sits down next to me. “Henry?” “Yeah?” “You are making me different.” “I know” I turn to look at Clare and just for a moment I forget that she is young, and that this is long ago; I see Clare, my wife, [[superimposed]] on the face of this young girl, and I don’t know what to say to this Clare who is old and young and different from other girls, who knows that different might be hard. But Clare doesn’t seem to expect an answer. She leans against my arm, and I put my arm around her shoulders.
“ Clare!” Across the quiet of the Meadow Clare’s dad is bellowing her name. Clare jumps up and grabs her shoes and socks. “It’s time for church ” she says, suddenly nervous. “Okay,” I say. “Um, bye.” I wave at her, and she smiles and mumbles goodbye and is running up the path, and is gone. I lie in the sun for a while, wondering about God, reading Dorothy Sayers. After an hour or so has passed I too am gone and there is only a blanket and a book, coffee cups, and clothing, to show that we were there at all.

AFTER THE END

Saturday, October 27, [[1984]] (Clare is [[13]], Henry is [[43]])

CLARE: I wake up suddenly. There was a noise: someone called my name. It sounded like Henry. I sit up in bed, listening. I hear the wind, and crows calling. But what if it was Henry? I jump out of bed and I run, with no shoes I run downstairs, out the back door, into the Meadow. It’s cold, the wind cuts right through my nightgown. Where is he? I stop and look and there, by the [[orchard]], there’s Daddy and Mark, in their bright orange hunting clothes, and there’s a man with them, they are all standing and looking at something but then they hear me and they turn and I see that the man is Henry. What is Henry doing with Daddy and Mark? I run to them, my feet cut by the dead grasses, and Daddy walks to meet me. “Sweetheart,” he says, “what are you doing out here so early?” “I heard my name” I say. He smiles at me. Silly girl, his smile says, and I look at Henry, to see if he will explain. Why did you call me, Henry? but he shakes his head and puts his finger to his lips, Shhh, don’t tell, Clare. He walks into the orchard and I want to see what they were looking at but there’s nothing there and Daddy says, “Go back to bed, Clare, it was just a dream.” He puts his arm around me and begins to walk back toward the house with me and I look back at Henry and he waves, he’s smiling, It’s okay, Clare, I’ll explain later (although knowing Henry he probably won’t explain, he’ll make me figure it out or it will explain itself one of these days). I wave back at him, and then I check to see if Mark saw that but Mark has his back to us, he’s irritated and is waiting for me to go away so he and Daddy can go back to hunting, but what is Henry doing here, what did they say to each other? I look back again but I don’t see Henry and Daddy says, “Go on, now, Clare, go back to bed,” and he kisses my forehead. He seems upset and so I run, run back to the house, and then softly up the stairs and then I am sitting on my bed, shivering, and I still don’t know what just happened, but I know it was bad, it was very, very bad.

Monday, February 2, [[1987]] (Clare is [[15]], Henry is [[38]])

CLARE: When I get home from school Henry is waiting for me in the Reading Room. I have fixed a little room for him next to the furnace room; it’s on the opposite side from where all the bicycles are. I have allowed it to be known in my household that I like to spend time in the basement reading, and I do in fact spend a lot of time in here, so that it doesn’t seem unusual. Henry has a chair [[wedged]] under the [[doorknob]]. I knock four knocks and he lets me in. He has made a sort of nest out of pillows and chair cushions and blankets, he has been
